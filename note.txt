We just publish out local git repo to remote GitHub.com repository.
Few things happened:
1. it automatically created new Remote Repo under your GitHub.com account
2. Made the connection with your local git repo
3. Added all your commits to remote repo


Now our work sill continue locally
1. add a new file called not.txt
2. commited the change to local repo
3. We want this change to be reflected in remote repository so we PUSHed local commits to remote repository using push origin button
4. Observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com


After adding sometext in sublime 
CTRL + S
If you dont save no changes will be shown in git

We do not have to push one commit at a time
